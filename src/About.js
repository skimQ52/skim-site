                    I am a fifth year student at the University of Guelph studying Computer Science.
                    I love to spend time outside, as well as hone my skills in various
                    sports. Equipped with a big smile and a positive mindset, I am a natural born leader.
                    As a competent programmerâ€”and an even better learner, solving problems excites me. Let's get
                    to work!
